# pokecode README

VSCode extension that plays Pokémon Red/Blue background music as you navigate code.

## How to use

Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-P and "Pokécode: Play Background Music" to play.

Similar to stop.

It uses https://preview.npmjs.com/package/play-sound to shell out to a terminal music player...so...yeah. 

If it gets stuck, `killall afplayer` or `killall mplayer`

## Features

- Plays Pokémon music
- Music was from https://www.zophar.net/music/gameboy-gbs/pokemon-red

## Known Issues

I've barely tested it, and only on a Mac - so probably lots.

### 0.13.7

Initial, and probably only, release.
